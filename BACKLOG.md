# Product Backlog

Below is a running list of user stories for the project management tools.

* **Timesheet entry** – As an employee I can log hours worked for each project so that my effort is tracked.
* **Project summary report** – As a project manager I can view total hours per project so that I understand progress.
* **Timesheet approvals with manager and admin sign-off** – As an employee I submit my timesheet for approval. My manager must approve first, then an administrator must sign off before the entry is locked for payroll and billing.
